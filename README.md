This repository contains my solution to the **Genentech ADS Programming
Assessment**. 


## Repository Structure

### `Question1` Folder

Contains all files related to **Question 1: SDTM DS domain creation**.

- **`question_1_sdtm_01_create_ds_domain.R`**  
  Main R script used to generate the SDTM DS domain.

- **`sdtm_ct.csv`**  
  Study-specific controlled terminology used for mapping disposition codes.

- **`ds_SDTM.csv`**  
  Final SDTM DS dataset produced by the Question 1 script.

- **`q1_run_log.txt`**  
  Execution log included as evidence that the code runs successfully without errors.
  
### `Question2` Folder

Contains all files related to **Question 2: ADaM ADSL dataset creation using the `{admiral}` package**.

- **`question_2_adam_create_ads1.R`**  
  Main R script used to create the ADaM ADSL (subject-level) dataset from SDTM input domains  
  (`pharmaversesdtm::dm`, `vs`, `ex`, `ds`, `ae`).  

- **`adam_adsl.csv`**  
  Final ADaM ADSL dataset generated by the Question 2 script. All derived variables are at the end of the dataset.

- **`q2_run_log.txt`**  
  Execution log provided as evidence that the Question 2 code runs successfully without errors.

### `Question3` Folder

Contains all files related to **Question 3: TLG – Adverse Events Reporting (Tables and Visualizations)**.

#### `question3_01_sumtable` Subfolder

Contains files related to the creation of the AE summary table.

- **`question_3_tlg_01_create_ae_summary_table.R`**  
  Main R script used to generate the FDA-style summary table of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

- **`AE_summary_table.html`**  
  HTML output of the AE summary table.

- **`q3_01_table_run_log.txt`**  
  Execution log included as evidence that the table-generation code runs successfully without errors.

#### `question3_02_visuals` Subfolder

Contains files related to the creation of AE visualizations using `{ggplot2}`.

- **`question_3_tlg_02_create_visualizations.R`**  
  Main R script used to generate AE visualizations, including:
  - AE severity distribution by treatment (stacked bar chart)
  - Top 10 most frequent AEs with 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (forest plot)

- **`ae_severity_by_treatment_barchart.png`**  
  Stacked bar chart showing AE severity distribution by treatment group.

- **`top_ten_ae_forest_plot.png`**  
  Forest plot showing the Top 10 most frequent adverse events with 95% confidence intervals.

- **`q3_02_visuals_run_log.txt`**  
  Execution log included as evidence that the visualization code runs successfully without errors.
